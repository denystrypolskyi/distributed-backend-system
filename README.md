# Distributed Back-end System

This is a pet microservices project that simulates a simple e-commerce platform.
It allows users to register, create and manage products, place orders, and automatically receive email notifications with order details such as total cost and purchased items.


## ðŸš€ Features

- Multiple independent microservices with separate PostgreSQL databases  
- Inter-service communication using REST API  
- Asynchronous event-based communication with RabbitMQ (Order â†’ Notification)  
- Centralized logging with Kafka and a dedicated `log-consumer` service  
- JWT-based user authentication  
- Unit and integration testing with JUnit and Mockito  
- Dockerized setup for easy local development


## ðŸ§© Microservices Overview

| Service | Description | Communication | Repository |
